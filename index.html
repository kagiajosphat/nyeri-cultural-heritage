<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
Nyeri Town is one of the most historically and culturally significant urban centres in Central Kenya. Located at the foothills of Mount Kenya, the town has evolved from a colonial administrative post into a vibrant commercial and governance hub. Its architectural landscape reflects three major historical phases: pre-independence, post-independence transformation, and modern development.
</p>
<p>
This platform documents emblematic landmarks that symbolize missionary influence, colonial administration, economic transition, African entrepreneurship, and modern urban growth.
